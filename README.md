## Project Details

### Challenge 1: Study Schedule

Developed a solution for determining the optimal time to make study materials available based on the highest number of students accessing the platform. The algorithm utilizes a brute-force strategy, and the function is tested with various inputs to assess its performance.

### Challenge 2: Encryption of Inversions

Implemented test cases for a message encryption function (`encrypt_message`). The tests ensure that the encryption function adheres to specific logic, enhancing code reliability.

### Challenge 3: Palindromes

Created a function to determine whether a given word is a palindrome or not. The algorithm uses a recursive approach and returns a boolean value. Special considerations are made for edge cases, such as an empty string.

### Challenge 4: Anagrams

Developed an algorithm to compare two strings, sorting them and determining whether they are anagrams. The function returns a tuple containing the sorted versions of both strings and a boolean indicating their anagram relationship. The implementation includes considerations for case insensitivity and utilizes a custom sorting function.

**Note:** Each challenge has its own file for implementation and testing, following the project structure provided by Trybe.
